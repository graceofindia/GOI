        <p style="font-size:18px"class="asd" id="a"> Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated as the birth anniversary of Lord Ganesha, the 
            Hindu god who is believed to be powerful enough to eliminate all obstacles. Falling in the months of August and September, 
            this is one of the festivals which Mumbaites celebrate with great zeal and enthusiasm. Lord Ganesh is regarded as
            the patron saint of Maharashtra and over 6000 idols are commissioned in Mumbai every year. This alone is enough to explain
             the spirit of Mumbai in celebrating the festival. Though Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Pune and
              Karnataka, Mumbai is the most famous for its massive processions. Even the households in Mumbai celebrate the festival by 
              installing an idol of Lord Ganesha and worshipping it for over ten days. The houses are cleaned and the idol is brought in 
              with the family members chanting 'Shloka' or religious verses. 
            The seven to ten days long festival ends with the 'Ganesh Visarjan' where<br> the idols are immersed in the water; it is done as
             a procession with millions of people accompanying the idol along with a lot of music and dance.

    <p style="font-size:18px" class="asd"> The year starts on the first day of Chaitra known as Gudi Padwa] which
        falls around March or April of the Western calendar. A gudi or victory pole is erected
         outside the house on this day. The special dish on the day includes Shreekhand. Neem leaves are eaten on 
         this day to ward off illness during the new year. Gudi Padwa, like Diwali Padwa and Dasara, is considered one 
         of the three and half auspicious days of the Marathi calendar. Astrological charts need not be consulted for 
         conducting important ceremonies, such as weddings, on these days.
          During Chaitra, women also hold a Haladi-kunku celebration.

            <p style="font-size:18px" class="asd">An important festival in Maharashtra, Nag Panchali is celebrated in the honour of the Snake 
                God Shesha Nag on the fifth day of the holy month of Shravan. Snake worship is an important ritual
                in India, and on this festival, cobras made of clay are venerated in homes. It is mainly celebrated
                for two reasons. Firstly, the abode of the nags (snakes) forms the bottom of the patal lok, and the 
                blessings of the nags are sought for the well-being of the family. Secondly, the nags (snakes) keep
                the crops safe from rats and rodents, and so the farmers pray to the nag-devta and offer their thanks.
                People make offerings of sweets and milk to the snake deity. Cobras are carried by snake charmers in 
                baskets and they collect offerings from the public in the streets. The day is celebrated with dances 
                and songs in the streets. People throng nag temples and also Shiva temples since the nag is very 
                closely associated with Lord Shiva.</p>

            <p style="font-size:18px" class="asd"> The Ellora festival is also popularly known as the Ellora Ajanta festival,
                 is organized by the Aurangabad festival Committee. This is a magnificent festival which is held in the surroundings

                  harmony of the occasion. It is a platform that showcases talents of classical music and dance from all over the world. 
                  This festival emphasizes on displaying the historical sites near the city of Aurangabad along with celebrating the Indian
                   classical form of art. The festival mainly promotes the old culture of India along with the temples caves which form the 
                   backdrop of the program. Seeing this dance and musical association you will be reminded of how rich our countryâ€™s cultural
                    background is and how we neglect these beautiful talents of the nation. It is spectacular to see these art forms being presented
