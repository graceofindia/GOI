		<p style="font-size:18px"class="asd" id="a">In Hinduism one is expected to follow so many rituals and customs that one would need a pandit to make god know that you are offering flowers, sweets and whatever.

            The general belief here is that if any such ritual is not done rightly as prescribed, you would end up getting the wrath of the deity rather than the blessing.
            
            However this is not considered so in the case of Ganesha, this elephant headed god is considered to be dearer to children and a friend to all. He is seen as a god who removes any obstacles in the path to success and hence is always given first priority when you pray to any other Hindu god.Ganesh chathurthi is the birthday function of lord Ganesh. Since he was born in the afternoon, the pooja too is best when done in the afternoon. Although in North India the pooja is done for an extended period of 3,5 or 9 to 11 days, in South India it is usually a one day celebration.

            New Ganesh Idols are bought or made from clay and installed at homes, after offering special delicacies that are favourite to him.After the pooja the idol (made from clay) is taken in a procession to a river or water source nearby and soaked into it.Generally Vinayaka Chathurthi is celebrated during the month of September just before the setting of Northeast monsoon in October.

            The dry summer would have made water sources porous and rivers might have been running shallowly. Thus the clay from the idols when suspended in water would form a colloid that would coagulate the pores and form a layer that has very fine pores.

    <p style="font-size:18px" class="asd">Gudi Padwa is the first day of Chaitra month that marks the beginning of the New Year according to lunisolar Hindu calendar.

        From the Brahma Purana, it's been inscribed that on this day Lord Brahma recreated the Earth, after the flood that overwhelmed it. Every single moment of the day on which Gudi Padwa is celebrated is regarded as very auspicious.
        
        Gudhi Padva is the Sanskrit name for Chaitra Shukla Pratipada. It is praised on the primary day of the Chaitra month to imprint the start of the New Year as designated by the lunisolar Hindu calendar. The word Padava originates from the Sanskrit word, which remains for the main day of the brilliant period of the moon called Pratipada in Sanskrit.
        
        This new moon day has unique importance from Astronomy viewpoint. The Sun should be in first purpose of Aries, (Hamal) which is first indication of zodiac and is a characteristic start of spring.
        
        Gudi padwa is called only in Maharastra and it's called as Ugadhi in many states, it's nothing but new year for Telangana, Andhra, Karnataka and other states and both are same it's a spring-time festival that marks the traditional new year for aboriginals of India.
        
        Scientifically, Intersection of equator with meridians is a major scientific event at the beginning of Chaitra. This intersection is known as Vasant, the pleasing season. When spring begins, nature refreshes itself by spreading a separate charm and gratifying atmosphere all over. This naturally blissful period is worth a celebration and Gudi Padwa appropriately represents this pleasing seasonal alteration.
        
        The festivity is observed by people engaging in spring cleaning and wearing new clothes. Families are supposed to begin this day by eating bittersweet leaves of neem tree or a paste which is prepared with neem leaves, jaggery and tamarind. The paste is believed to purify blood and strengthen the bodyâ€™s immune system

			<p style="font-size:18px" class="asd">The reference to Kumbh parva can be found in Puranas of different times. It also finds mention in Mahabharata and Ramayana. But these references are not very old. If we consider the 18 Puranas, we find that the story is almost the same everywhere, but the characters are different. All these stories, however, are indicative and need to be explained.Because Jupiter rotates after every half an hour. Its speed of rotation is less. It absorbs less energy from the sun and releases more. Hence in astrology we say that the place where Jupiter resides is destroyed but the place at which it is directed flourishes. These 48 places are known as Ahargan in Vedas. What I am saying may not be true. This study will need more research with modern equipment and instruments. We also need to study the structure of water molecules at these four places. We can make a note of the saliva, urine, ECG, EEG readings of people before and after the holy dip. As of now, we do not have instruments to study all this. A scientist took the photo of a molecule of water and found it to be abstract. He then took that drop in hand and prayed. When photographed again, the abstract design had changed to a beautiful pattern like a rangoli.Like we studied sun, we also need to study the angle of moon and its connection with Jupiter. The shahi snan is usually held on poornima (full moon) or amavasya (no moon). We need to study what can happen on earth during these days. Researcher Norman Vincent Peale, as part of a study, made mentally-challenged patients from 27 in New York hospitals wear Saffron-coloured clothes. It was found that fits in these patients reduced by 68 per cent. This is on official record.</p>
