        <p style="font-size:22px"class="asd" id="a">Men wear dhoti with a shirt known as the pheta in Maharashtra. They also wear headdress, which is a folded cap of made of cotton, silk or woolen cloth. It can also be a freshly folded turban known as rumal, patka, phet. Pagadi, the prepared form of turban was also used to wear, but it is rarely used this days. Bandi, a type of waistcoat or jacket is also worn over the shirt.

Dhoti is made of cotton cloth, which is nearly two and half to three meters long, with or without borders on both the sides. A type of dhoti, which has five tucks, three into the waistband at the two sides and in front, while the loose end is tucked in front and behind is very popular amongst the Maratha Brahmans. For durable hand-made dhotis, Nagpur-made are most popular.

But these are the traditional clothing, which were popular up to three decades back. Now the younger generations wear the latest fashion wears of any kind.

    <p style="font-size:22px" class="asd"> Women wear sarees that are 9 yards long. The saree is tucked in the middle giving it a similar look to the dhoti. The rest of the saree is wrapped around the upper body of the women. This type of saree is usually called Lugade. There were many variations in how women wear their saree. Some only wear knee length sarees. Some wear it in a skirt manner without the tuck in the middle. But the 9-yard saree is the traditional costume of women in Maharashtra.

            <p style="font-size:22px" class="asd">Women traditionally preferred to go barefoot and found it only natural to do so while on occasion would wear sandals. The footwear in Maharashtra is famous for its durability and longevity.

The Kolhapuri chappals are open-toed sandals in a t-strap shape that are handmade by the Maharashtrian from leather and are tanned using vegetable dyes. Kolhapuri chappal originated in the Kolhapur District of Maharashtra and are worldly known for its strength and endurance. Maharashtrians seem to have the same style of attire for everything they do - whether it is resting or attending a wedding or travelling. The only thing that differs is the material. Cotton is used for making attires for all occasions and is cheap whereas silk is relatively expensive and used for making garments for weddings, festivals and other such events.</p>
