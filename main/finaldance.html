    <p style="font-size:18px" class="asd"> Tamasha, as a theatre form, is a style that can be called a mix of a regular play, a musical and dance. It has two main branches â€“ Dholki Bhaari and Sangeet Bhaari. While the Dholki Bhaari style has a lot more drama, the Sangeet Bhaari style is a lot more music and dance oriented. Tamasha is known for its suggestive lyrics and borderline erotic movements and topics.

        Tamasha is highly influenced by other Indian dance forms like Dashavatara, Kaveli, Kathak, Ghazals, Lalit and Kirtan. Some other folk art forms like the Powada and Gavalan, have their origin in Tamasha and are also utilised in this form.Tamasha is performed across Maharashtra even today by local or travelling troupes.The history of the Tamasha dance can be traced back to the 16th century when it was believed to have originated as an entertainment form for the Mughal troops deployed in the Deccan Plateau. Later in 18th century, it acquired a distinct form during the late Peshwa period of the Maratha Empire. With the development of the textile industry in Bombay during the 19th century, a lot of people migrated to the city from the rural areas in search of employment.The word tamasha in Persian language means fun and entertainment. The tamasha dance form has been believed to be derived from the ancient form of Sanskrit drama - the 'Prahsana' and the 'Bhana'. Modern Tamasha troupes are of two sections - Song-dance troupe and Folk-drama troupe. Kolhati and Mahar communities are associated with Tamasha.The poet singers known as shahirs, composed many narrative and love songs for Tamasha.Kathak, kavali and ghazal songs reflect to any Tamasha performance. Tamasha is generally started with a devotional song and is followed by the dramatic sequence known as 'Gaulan'.

			<p style="font-size:18px" class="asd">Koli dance is performed by both men and womenfolk. They generally form single line or stand in pairs. In one of the forms, the fisherman stand in a row holding their oars while the women form a separate row linking their arms and approaching the men folk in a tantalizing manner. As the rhythm of music reaches a crescendo, separation of the men and women gives away to them dancing in unison. One of the most important characteristics of this dance is the simulation of rowing of boats, the movement of waves and act of catching fish. The dance tends to vary in style depending on the region. Me Dolker, Aga Pori Sambhaal, Dol Doltai, Paru Go Paru and Valav Re Nakva are some of the popular songs that dancers perform to. The audience thoroughly enjoys this dance and shows their appreciation by whistling and a lot of merry making. Another variation of the Koli dance has the women jumping between sticks held by men.While performing Koli dance,women are generally dressed in green-colored saris that are draped up to their knee. On other hand,men wear lungis around their waists that form triangular shape.</p>
