     <h1 align="center" style="color:greenyellow"><u>About Maharashtra</u></h1><br>
     <center><p style="font-size: 105%;">The name Maharashtra, denoting the western upland of the Deccan plateau, first appeared in a 7th-century inscription and in the account of Xuanzang, a Chinese traveler at that time. According to one interpretation,<br> the name derives from the word maharathi (great chariot driver), which refers to a skillful northern fighting force that migrated southward into the area. The groupâ€™s language, intermingled with the speech <br>of the earlier Naga settlers, became Maharastri, which by the 8th century had developed into Marathi. There was also a continuous influx of people from remote Greece and Central Asia.During that early period <br>the territory constituting the present-day state of Maharashtra was divided between several Hindu kingdoms: Satavahana, Vakataka, Kalacuri, Rashtrakuta, Chalukya, and Yadava. A succession of Muslim dynasties<br> ruled after 1307. Persian, the court language of the Muslims, had a far-reaching effect on the Marathi language. By the mid-16th century, Maharashtra was again fragmented between several independent Muslim rulers,<br> who fought each other endlessly. It was in the midst of that chaos that a great leader, Shivaji, was born in 1627. Shivaji showed astonishing prowess by founding a large Maratha empire that shook Delhi-based Mughal rule to its foundations.</p></center>
